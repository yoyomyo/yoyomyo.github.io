During the COVID pandemic in 2020, I started reading with my friends regularly. It was the best socialization necessitated by the pandemic because reading gives us an excuse to meet online regularly, with non-trivial subjects to discuss. So far, I read three books with friends over the pandemic: _Bothers_ 《兄弟》 by 余华 Yu Hua, _Invisible Planets_《中国科幻小说集》 translated by Ken Liu who also translated _the Three Body Problem_《三体》, and The Pragmatic Programmer.

I am a very slow reader especially when it comes to technical books. I try to set my friend's expectation low. Usually we agree to read one or two chapters and then meet up to discuss the content. I also tend to have very bad memory therefore I created this site with Jekyll to help me remember the wonderful books I read with my friends.
